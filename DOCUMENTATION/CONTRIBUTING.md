# CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions to the project must follow a specific coding guideline for uniformity. These standards will aid in the overall
ability to develop and distribute this additional functionality to all users with little to no modifications of the main
project.

At times there will be requirements to modify the underlying functionality of the main application, however; this is only
after the module has been vetted by project maintainers and tested to ensure the functionality will deliver 100% of the time
or within reasonable stop gaps and exception handlers to provide a clean user experience. Please see the styling guides for additional information on these coding requirements.
